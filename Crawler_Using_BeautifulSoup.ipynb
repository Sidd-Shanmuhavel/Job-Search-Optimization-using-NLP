I currently have a temporary recording studio setup at my Airbnb that will allow me to record and edit the threading/multiprocessing videos. I am going to be moving into my new house in 10 days and once I have my recording studio setup then you can expect much faster video releases. I really appreciate how patient everyone has been while I go through this move, especially those of you who are contributing monthly through YouTube \n",

      "In this Python Programming Tutorial, we will be learning the difference between using “==” and the “is” keyword when doing comparisons. The difference between these is that “==” checks to see if values are equal, and the “is” keyword checks their identity, which means it’s going to check if the values are identical in terms of being the same object in memory. We’ll learn more in the video. Let’s get started…\n",
